# Git
Git for beginners
This is the foundation of git. To summarize, using our photo analogy:

git init: Creates a box in which to permanently store panoramic pictures.
git add: Takes a temporary photo of one thing that can be assembled into a panoramic photo later.
git commit: Assembles all available temporary photos into a panoramic photo. Also destroys all temporary photos.
git log: Lists all the panoramic photos weâ€™ve ever taken.
git show: Looks at what is in a particular panoramic photo.
git checkout: Rearranges files back to how they looked in a given panoramic photo. Does not affect the panormiac photos in your box in any way.
